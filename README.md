# SOLD - A Benchmark for Sinhala Offensive Language Identification

In this repository, we introduce the {S}inhala {O}ffensive {L}anguage {D}ataset **(SOLD)** and present multiple experiments on this dataset. **SOLD** is a manually annotated dataset containing 10,000 posts from Twitter annotated as offensive and not offensive at both sentence-level and token-level. **SOLD** is the largest offensive language dataset compiled for Sinhala. We also introduce **SemiSOLD**, a larger dataset containing more than 145,000 Sinhala tweets, annotated following a semi-supervised approach.

:warning: This repository contains texts that may be offensive and harmful.

## Annotation
We use an annotation scheme split into two levels deciding (a) Offensiveness of a tweet (sentence-level) and (b) Tokens that contribute to the offence at sentence-level (token-level).

### Sentence-level 
Our sentence-level offensive language detection follows level A in OLID [(Zampieri et al., 2019)](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1144/). We asked annotators to discriminate between the following types of tweets:
* **Offensive (OFF)**: Posts containing any form of non-acceptable language (profanity) or a targeted offence, which can be veiled or direct. This includes insults, threats, and posts containing profane language or swear words.
* **Not Offensive (NOT)**: Posts that do not contain offense or profanity.

Each tweet was annotated with one of the above labels, which we used as the labels in sentence-level offensive language identification.

### Token-level
To provide a human explanation of labelling, we collect rationales for the offensive language. Following HateXplain [(Mathew et al., 2021)](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17745), we define a rationale as a specific text segment that justifies the human annotator’s decision of the sentence-level labels. Therefore, We ask the annotators to highlight particular tokens in a tweet that supports their judgement about the sentence-level label (offensive, not offensive). Specifically, if a tweet is offensive, we guide the annotators to highlight tokens from the text that supports the judgement while including non-verbal expressions such as emojis and morphemes that are used to convey the intention as well. We use this as token-level offensive labels in SOLD.

## Data
SOLD is released in HuggingFace. It can be loaded in to pandas dataframes using the following code. 

```python
from datasets import Dataset
from datasets import load_dataset

sold_train = Dataset.to_pandas(load_dataset('sinhala-nlp/SOLD', split='train'))
sold_test = Dataset.to_pandas(load_dataset('sinhala-nlp/SOLD', split='test'))
```
The dataset contains of the following columns. 
* **post_id** - Twitter ID
* **text** - Post text
* **tokens** - Tokenised text. Each token is seperated by a space. 
* **rationals** - Offensive tokens. If a token is offensive it is shown as 1 and 0 otherwise.
* **label** - Sentence-level label, offensive or not-offensive.

SemiSOLD is also released HuggingFace and can be loaded to a pandas dataframe using the following code. 

```python
from datasets import Dataset
from datasets import load_dataset

semi_sold = Dataset.to_pandas(load_dataset('sinhala-nlp/SemiSOLD', split='train'))
```
The dataset contains following columns 
* **post_id** - Twitter ID
* **text** - Post text

Furthermore it contains predicted offensiveness scores from nine classifiers trained on SOLD train; xlmr, xlmt, mbert, sinbert, lstm_ft, cnn_ft, lstm_cbow, cnn_cbow, lstm_sl, cnn_sl and svm


## Experiments
Clone the repository and install the libraries using the following command (preferably inside a conda environment)

~~~
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

### Sentence-level
Sentence-level transformer based experiments can be executed using the following command. 

~~~
python -m experiments.sentence_level.sinhala_deepoffense
~~~

The command takes the following arguments;

~~~
--model_type : Type of the transformer model (bert, xlmroberta, roberta etc ).
--model_name : The exact architecture and trained weights to use. This may be a Hugging Face Transformers compatible pre-trained model, a community model, or the path to a directory containing model files.
--transfer : Whether to perform transfer learning or not (true or false).
--transfer_language : The initial language if transfer learning is performed (hi, en or si).
    * hi - Perform transfer learning from HASOC 2019 Hindi dataset (Modha et al., 2019).
    * en - Perform transfer learning from Offenseval English dataset (Zampieri et al., 2019).
    * si - Perform transfer learning from CCMS Sinhala dataset (Rathnayake et al., 2019).
--augment : Perform semi supervised data augmentation.
--std : Standard deviation of the models to cut down data augmentation.
--augment_type: The type of the data augmentation.
    * off - Augment only the offensive instances.
    * normal - Augment both offensive and non-offensive instances.
