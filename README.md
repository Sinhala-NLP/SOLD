# SOLD - A Benchmark for Sinhala Offensive Language Identification

In this repository, we introduce the {S}inhala {O}ffensive {L}anguage {D}ataset **(SOLD)** and present multiple experiments on this dataset. **SOLD** is a manually annotated dataset containing 10,000 posts from Twitter annotated as offensive and not offensive at both sentence-level and token-level. **SOLD** is the largest offensive language dataset compiled for Sinhala. We also introduce **SemiSOLD**, a larger dataset containing more than 145,000 Sinhala tweets, annotated following a semi-supervised approach.
